        <span class="fs-4 fw-bolder"
          >The Congress API returns the following types of data:</span
        >
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Roll-call vote data:</span> Only
          roll-call votes (not voice votes or division votes) are tracked by
          official Congressional data sources. Along with basic vote data, the
          ProPublica API returns additional information that is less readily
          available, such as party totals. Votes are available from 1991 for the
          House of Representatives and from 1989 for the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Member data:</span> Along with general
          biographical information for current and past members of Congress, the
          API returns data about members’ Congressional roles. Role data
          includes the Congress number and chamber, as well as the member’s
          title, state and party. A single member may have more than one role in
          a particular Congress (for example, the member may switch parties or
          move from the House to the Senate). The API also helps you compare
          member data, including vote positions and bill cosponsorships. Member
          data is available for every member who has served in Congress, but
          those who have served more recently (since 1995) have more
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Personal explanations:</span> Statements
          inserted into the Congressional Record explaining why lawmakers missed
          votes and what their votes would have been (the statements are merely
          explanations and have no effect on the vote itself).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Bill data:</span> Along with standard
          bill summaries and details, the API returns bill subjects, amendments
          and related bills. You can also retrieve bills by member, view all the
          cosponsors of a bill, and search for bill subjects. Bill information
          is available for bills from 1995 onward. Full-text search of bills is
          also available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Nomination data:</span> The API returns
          presidential civilian nomination lists and details. Military
          nominations are not included. For general information about
          presidential nominations, see Congress.gov. Nomination data is
          available from 2001 onward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Floor actions:</span> Descriptions of
          legislative activity that are updated in near real-time throughout the
          day. This endpoint exists for both the House and the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Committee data:</span> The API returns
          data about House and Senate committees, along with the memberships of
          those committees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="fs-5 fw-bolder">Other data:</span> The API returns
          various supplemental information, including party counts by state; and
          committees and committee rosters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the data in the ProPublica Congress API is updated daily,
          while votes are updated every 30 minutes.
